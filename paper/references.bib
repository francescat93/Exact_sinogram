        scikit-image is an image processing library that implements algorithms and utilities for use in research, education and industry applications. It is released under the liberal Modified BSD open source license, provides a well-documented API in the Python programming language, and is developed by an active, international team of collaborators. In this paper we highlight the advantages of open source to achieve the goals of the scikit-image library, and we showcase several real-world image processing applications that use scikit-image. More information can be found on the project homepage, http://scikit-image.org.

The solution found is applicable to three problems of interest for precise radiology and radiotherapy: the determination of a variable x-ray absorption coefficient in two dimensions; the determination of the distribution of positron annihilations when there is an inhomogeneous distribution of the positron emitter in mattet; and the determination of a variable density of matter with constant chemical composition, using the energy loss of charged particles in the matter.
